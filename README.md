# word-asker

a simple c++ program that asks meaning of the words from a txt given. (Asks a random word and when enter is pressed it reveals the answer and asks a new word instantaneously, so doesn't take any response from the user) The ideal format is something like:

apple - manzana\
cat - gato\
water - agua\
\
but the program is capable a little bit more than that so i leave an example with a blank line etc.
